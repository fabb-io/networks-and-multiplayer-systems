3D co-op multiplayer videogame in Unity

In this course we studied the foundamentals of networks, and multiplayer system.
We ended up the course by have a project dedicated at the subject, a 3D videogame we 2 player can co-op and play a little stage together.
We decided, due to the little time we had, to take the 3D videgame we made in the other subject and modify it from single-player to a co-op multiplayer.
Was quite a challenge due to all the interaction e possibilities caused by 2 player interacting with a system, but we ended up having a well put together project.

Here the link to the files(the project are heavy and git is giving me trouble uploading them):

If you're trying to use our project:
to play with a friend you'll be given the possibility to host a game, and on your screen will appear a code, 
the other player need that code in order to play together.
The main function are the shooting system and the seft controlled Ai-enemies,
main buttons for movement are WASD and SPACE for jumping,
for the shooting and movement direction you'll use the mouse axis and MOUSE1 and MOUSE2,
there a lot of mechanics and I hope you'll fell courious to discover them.
